Find your Java Voice - New Speaker Night
</h1>
<p> 
<h2> Details</h2></p>
<p>This is a placeholder for the event which is being run on Eventbrite. See the full details and register here: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/find-your-java-voice-new-speaker-night-tickets-44485579566

Speaking at conferences , meet ups and the like can be a major boost to your career. Getting started though can be tough. Not only do you need to summon the courage to stand up in front of your peers you often find that to get accepted to a conference you need a video of you speaking. Talk about a catch-22.

The LJC, Devoxx UK, RecWorks and IBM team want to help new speakers overcome these challenges

In this event new speakers will get the chance to get feedback and advice from seasoned developers who speak at conferences and meet-ups and IBM will be providing a professional film crew who will film each speaker and create individual 5 minute videos. Only 20 places are available so please register as soon as possible. ***Speaking slots are now full. Please email dc@recworks.co.uk if you would like to be added to the waiting list.***

To make this more realistic we need more than new speakers - we need an audience. So even if you donâ€™t want to speak at a conference come along and support those brave developers who do.

If you want to take advantage of this opportunity to practise speaking and get that video, sign up today! The only requirement is that you come along with a 5 minute lightning talk already to go. The subject can be on anything related to computers. No slides are necessary (though you can bring them if it helps)

Advice and guidance to the new speakers will come from Steve Poole, Mo Haghighi, Richard Warburton, Martijn Verburg and Simon Maple.</p>

<p>Tonight's venue and refreshments are kindly provided by IBM.
